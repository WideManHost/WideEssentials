# WideEssentials
Designer Scripts, Managers, Utility Classes and whatnot. Free to use on any kind of unity project. Uses UltEvents, however a non-UltEvents version will be released.

## Overview

These are a set of scripts which I plan to use for future projects, they will be maintained over the span of my career unless I deprecate it or quit game dev. Anyone is able to use these scripts and my code (Hell you could even improve this or tear it all down!), I only ask for attribution on this, and any future edits you make. I encourage programmers to work up on my systems.

Anyways I got the idea to make these after seeing how a friend of mine (hinestraza) is able to make crazy #*@& happen with just a collection of designer scripts used in the Rude Editor (ULTRAKILL custom level editor). Showing me this potential, I changes my coding philosophy, realising the power of simple scripts over a convoluted system. 

### Installation

Navigate to the releases section (should be on the right of the project structure) and click releases.

There should be 2 files for each release:
- Main (Uses UltEvents, **recommended**)
- Standalone (No external dependancies)

Download which `.unitypackage` file suits your project the best and drag it into the editor and It'll add the scripts to the project.

If the ULTRAKILL custom level community really wants it, I might consider making an ULTRAKILL release that uses UltrakillEvents and Unityevents and whatnot.

## Bug reporting
If you run across a bug, please do make a bug report in the Issues tab of this repository. Please explain the details of the bug/error, how you found it whatnot.

Now if you're really cool and want to propose a suggestion or even push up a bug fix yourself, please by all means create a pull request!

## Credits

### UltEvents

This project uses/depends on [UltEvents](https://kybernetik.com.au/ultevents) an addon for the Unity Engine. Please install this if you're using the main release. Otherwise you can use the Standalone release that uses normal UnityEvents instead, losing the extra functionality. Please be sure to review the license that UltEvents has (which is CC 4.0 International).

### Rotation Clamp
The `RotationClamp.cs` script was created by [Jonathan](https://github.com/JDoddsNAIT), Go check out his projects!

## Documenation

Unfortunately I am not equipped with the time to create documentation for the code. However there code is adequately commented, and there should be summaries for each method. Maybe in the future I'll be able to provide documentation.
